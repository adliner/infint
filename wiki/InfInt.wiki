#summary Briefly describes how to use the InfInt library.

= Introduction =

InfInt is simply a lightweight large integer library which consists of a header file. So, all you have to do is to include the header file provided and start using huge integers in your applications.

= Details =

It is pretty straight forward to use the library. Just create an instance of InfInt class and start using it.

Useful methods:
   intSqrt:        integer square root operation
   digitAt:        returns digit at index
   numberOfDigits: returns number of digits
   size:           returns size in bytes
   toString:       converts it to a string

There are also conversion methods which allow conversion to primitive types: toInt, toLong, toLongLong, toUnsignedInt, toUnsignedLong, toUnsignedLongLong.

You may define INFINT_USE_EXCEPTIONS and library methods will start raising InfIntException in case of error instead of writing error messages using std::cerr.
